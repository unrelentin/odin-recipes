        <div style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">Ingredients</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>12 ounces Spam</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup oyster sauce</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
                    <li>Nori roasted seaweed cut into halves or thirds</li>
                    <li>6 cups cooked sushi rice WITHOUT VINEGAR</li>
                </ul>
        
        <div style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">Instructions</div>
                <ol>
                    <li><div style="font-weight: bold;">Slice the SPAM into about 8-10 slices (depending on how thick you like it) and put in a Ziplock bag. 
                        Mix oyster sauce, soy sauce, and sugar until sugar is dissolved and add to the bag with the SPAM. 
                        Marinate for about 15 minutes.</div></li>

                    <li><div style="font-weight: bold;">Drain off marinade and fry SPAM on each side over medium heat until slightly crispy or until desired doneness. 
                        Some people like to glaze the SPAM with the marinade/sauce AFTER frying, either way tastes great!</div></li>

                    <li><div style="font-weight: bold;">Place a strip of nori on a cutting board or clean surface (shiny side down). Place your Musubi mold across the middle of the nori. 
                        Add Sushi Rice to the mold, pressing down firmly and evenly so there is about 1-1 1/2 inches of rice. 
                        Dip the mold and your fingers in water as you go to prevent sticking.</div></li>
                    
                    <li><div style="font-weight: bold;">Next, remove the mold from the rice. Now you will have a nice little block of rice right on the nori. 
                        Add some of the cooked SPAM to the top. Wrap up one side of the nori and stick it to the top of the SPAM, then wrap up the other side. Just like you are wrapping a nice little package.
                         Use a little water on your finger to seal if needed. Serve warm.</div></li>
                    
                    <li><div style="font-weight: bold;">Some like it dipped in soy sauce, some like it with ketchup, and some like it as is.</div></li>
                </ol>
